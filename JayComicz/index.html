    As the year 2020 comes to a close, Marvel Comics will begin their first major comic event of 2021 starting in December. 
    "KING IN BLACK" #1 will see Venom along with other heroes across the Marvel Universe battle the symbiote God <b>KNULL</b>. 
    This will be an event like none other, taking horror to a whole new level in Marvel Comic history.
    As writer Donny Cates promises that this event will shake up the marvel universe forever. 
    I've been a huge fan of Donny Cates run alongside the amazing artists 
    who've been working on it so I'm definitely buying this and all the tie-ins!
    <br>
    "WOLVERINE BLACK, WHITE, & BLOOD" #1 starts to release beginning November 4 and will entail untold adventures of the mutants past. 
    Each issue will contain three action-packed adventures of Logan in the format color of black, white, and bloody red! 
    Marvel Comics has brought top-notch artist for this one so I'm going to buy the first issue to check it out. Honestly, Wolverine adventures 
    are usually some of the best of stories in Marvel Comics so I feel it won't dissappoint.
