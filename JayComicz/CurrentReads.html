    <h2>Venom (2018)</h2>
    <div class="part1"></div>
    <img src="../ComicSiteMedia/Venom/Venom (2018).jpg" class="img1" height="600px" width="400px" alt="Venom (2018)">
    <p> I've always loved Venom and Spiderman as a kid so this series was easy to get into. 
        Donny Cates has brought some new lore to the Venomverse with the current run of his 
        Venom series which has made it one of the hottest comics to get now. </p>

    <h2>Daredevil</h2>
    <img src="../ComicSiteMedia/DareDevil.jpg" height="400px" width="400px" alt="Daredevil">
    <p> Looking for that classic street-level superhero? Well, Daredevil can fill that slot in for you.
        Writer Chip Zdarsky's current run on Daredevil reminds of the Netflix series that was cancelled, 
        always keeping you suspensed and ready to pick up the next episode. This series is one of the best things Marvel Comics
        has going on right now. Since Im also a New Yorker, it's cool read on a local hero that resides in Hell's Kitchen. 
        I highly suggest picking up this series if you'd like to see more of Daredevil fighting crime against Kingpin, The Hand, 
        corrupt police/politicians, and sometimes... himself?    </p>

    <img src="../ComicSiteMedia/The Immortal Hulk.jpg" height="400px" width="400px" alt="The Immortal Hulk">
    <p> Bruce Banner has resurrected from the dead after the events of CIVIL WAR 2! 
        Al Ewing has taken the hulk into a different light, mixing in bodily horror and giving him a terrifying vibe unlike before. 
        Its twisted, exciting, scary, and cool in all the right places. he is no longer the Savage Hulk, but <b>THE IMMORTAL HULK.</b></p>

    <h2>One-Punch Man</h2>
    <img src="../ComicSiteMedia/OnePunchMan.png" height="400px" width="400px" alt="One Punch Man">  
    <p>My Current favorite <b>Manga</b>, One-Punch Man tells the adventures of a Hero for fun who seeks to find a worthy adversary. 
       After training and becoming the strongest there is, life has become boring. 
       The Manga makes jokes at common tropes in anime and is able to make me laugh everytime. 
       However, the mood can quickly shift from funny to serious as the story progresses and 
       you realize it's not just a comedy, but an action-packed adventure. 
       The writer also makes you interested in the other characters and their backstories, along with making cool designs for them. </p>
