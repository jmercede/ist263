    <body>My name is Jayshawn Mercedes.

        I’m currently studying within the iSchool completing a bachelor’s in Information Studies. I started in Information Studies because programming has been one of my career interests for a long time. Learning code and information science is a core skill I could use in any job, and I have always thought building websites or programs with code is very cool. I’m not certain about my career path yet, but studying in the iSchool can guide me into what concentration of Information Studies I want to focus on. 
        I could then use these skills within agencies like Homeland Security or the CIA and help people across the global. Working in these environments would keep me on my feet since there’s never a time the world is completely safe from cyber-attacks or data breaches. 
        Recently, I’ve been trying to immerse myself into different physical activities like soccer. 
        I’ve been practicing how to juggle a soccer ball for awhile and am trying to master it. I’m an outside person in general, and you could always find me running or exercising when given the chance. I find it as a great way to relieve stress and boost my confidence. 
        I’m also taking Spanish lessons online and have been trying to improve so that I can speak it correctly with my family. Learning about languages and cultures is one of my hobbies that I do research and take classes on. I find it fascinating how a person’s culture and heritage can shape who they become today and wan to learn more about people from other parts of the globe. 
        When I’m not taking working out, Reading and watching anime are other forms of entertainment for me. Books help keep my imagination alive and help me escape stress if I’m having a bad day. I read all kinds of books, but my favorites would have to be Mystery, Suspense, thriller, and sci-fi. I’m also a huge comic book fan and have kept up with current marvel and DC comics.
